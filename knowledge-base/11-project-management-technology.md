# Project Management in Technology

## Project Management Fundamentals

### What is Project Management?
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. It involves initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects to achieve specific goals within constraints.

### Project Constraints (Triple Constraint)
1. **Scope**: What needs to be delivered
2. **Time**: When it needs to be delivered
3. **Cost**: Budget available for delivery
4. **Quality**: Standards and acceptance criteria (fourth constraint)

### Project Lifecycle Phases
1. **Initiation**: Project charter, stakeholder identification
2. **Planning**: Detailed project plan, resource allocation
3. **Execution**: Deliverable creation, team management
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**: Progress tracking, change management
5. **Closing**: Project completion, lessons learned

## Traditional Project Management

### Waterfall Methodology
**Characteristics**:
- **Sequential Phases**: Each phase completed before next begins
- **Documentation Heavy**: Comprehensive documentation at each stage
- **Predictable**: Clear timeline and deliverables
- **Change Resistant**: Difficult to accommodate changes

**Phases**:
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Complete requirement definition
2. **System Design**: Architecture and detailed design
3. **Implementation**: Code development
4. **Testing**: System and user acceptance testing
5. **Deployment**: Production release
6. **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and bug fixes

**Best Suited For**:
- Well-defined requirements
- Regulatory environments
- Large, complex systems
- Fixed-price contracts

**Knowledge Areas**:
1. **Project Integration Management**: Coordinating all aspects
2. **Project Scope Management**: Defining and controlling scope
3. **Project Schedule Management**: Planning and controlling timeline
4. **Project Cost Management**: Planning, estimating, and controlling costs
5. **Project Quality Management**: Meeting quality requirements
6. **Project Resource Management**: Planning and managing team
7. **Project Communications Management**: Information distribution
