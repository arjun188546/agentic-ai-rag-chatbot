- **Best For**: Sensitive data, regulatory compliance, predictable workloads

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Description**: Combination of public and private clouds
- **Connectivity**: Orchestrated between environments
- **Advantages**: Flexibility, cost optimization, gradual migration
- **Disadvantages**: Complex management, integration challenges
- **Best For**: Burst workloads, data sensitivity levels, legacy systems

### Multi-Cloud
- **Description**: Use of multiple cloud computing services
- **Strategy**: Distribute workloads across different providers
- **Advantages**: Avoid vendor lock-in, optimize costs, improve reliability
- **Disadvantages**: Increased complexity, skill requirements
- **Best For**: Risk mitigation, best-of-breed solutions

## Key Cloud Technologies
