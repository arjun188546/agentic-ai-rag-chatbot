# Software Development Methodologies

## Traditional Methodologies

### Waterfall Model
- **Characteristics**: Linear, sequential phases
- **Phases**: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
- **Advantages**: Clear structure, well-documented, predictable
- **Disadvantages**: Inflexible, late testing, assumes stable requirements
- **Best For**: Well-defined projects, regulatory environments, fixed requirements

### V-Model (Verification and Validation)
- **Structure**: V-shaped, testing phases correspond to development phases
- **Phases**: Requirements ↔ Acceptance Testing, Design ↔ System Testing, Coding ↔ Unit Testing
- **Advantages**: Early test planning, clear deliverables
- **Disadvantages**: Rigid, expensive to make changes
- **Best For**: Safety-critical systems, well-understood domains

### Spiral Model
- **Approach**: Iterative risk-driven development
- **Phases**: Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation
- **Advantages**: Risk management, flexibility, early prototypes
- **Disadvantages**: Complex, expensive, requires risk assessment expertise
- **Best For**: Large, complex projects with high uncertainty

## Agile Methodologies

### Agile Manifesto Principles
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

- **Development Team**: Cross-functional team building the product

**Artifacts:**
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features and requirements
- **Sprint Backlog**: Work selected for current sprint
- **Product Increment**: Potentially shippable product increment

**Events:**
- **Sprint**: Time-boxed iteration (1-4 weeks)

- **Daily Standup**: Brief daily synchronization meeting
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Team reflects on process improvements

### Kanban
- **Principles**: Visualize work, limit work in progress, manage flow
- **Board Columns**: To Do → In Progress → Done (customizable)
- **Benefits**: Continuous flow, flexibility, visual management
- **Metrics**: Lead time, cycle time, throughput
- **Best For**: Continuous delivery, maintenance work, varying priorities

### Extreme Programming (XP)
**Practices:**
- **Pair Programming**: Two developers work together on same code
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before code
- **Continuous Integration**: Frequent code integration and testing
- **Simple Design**: Simplest solution that works
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve code structure
- **Small Releases**: Frequent delivery of working software

### Lean Software Development
**Principles:**
1. **Eliminate Waste**: Remove non-value-adding activities
2. **Amplify Learning**: Build knowledge through short iterations
3. **Decide as Late as Possible**: Keep options open
4. **Deliver as Fast as Possible**: Rapid delivery
5. **Empower the Team**: Give teams authority to make decisions
6. **Build Integrity In**: Quality built into process
7. **See the Whole**: Optimize entire value stream

## Modern Methodologies

### DevOps
- **Philosophy**: Collaboration between development and operations
- **Practices**: Continuous integration, continuous deployment, infrastructure as code
- **Tools**: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, monitoring tools
- **Benefits**: Faster delivery, improved quality, better collaboration
- **Culture**: Shared responsibility, automation, measurement

### DevSecOps
- **Extension**: Integrate security into DevOps pipeline
- **Shift Left**: Security considerations early in development
- **Practices**: Security testing automation, compliance as code
- **Tools**: Static analysis, dependency scanning, container security
- **Benefits**: Reduced security vulnerabilities, faster remediation

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- **Origin**: Google's approach to operations
- **Principles**: Service level objectives, error budgets, automation
- **Practices**: Monitoring, incident response, capacity planning
- **Balance**: Feature development vs. reliability
- **Metrics**: Availability, latency, error rate, throughput

## Project Management Approaches

### Traditional Project Management
- **Framework**: Project Management Institute (PMI) PMBOK
- **Knowledge Areas**: Integration, scope, time, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholders
- **Process Groups**: Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, closing
- **Tools**: Gantt charts, work breakdown structure, critical path method

### Agile Project Management
- **Approaches**: Scrum, Kanban, SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
- **Focus**: Adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery
- **Metrics**: Velocity, burn-down charts, cycle time
- **Ceremonies**: Regular retrospectives, demos, planning sessions

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Water-Scrum-Fall**: Waterfall planning, Scrum development, Waterfall deployment
- **Disciplined Agile**: Choice-driven hybrid framework
- **SAFe**: Scaled Agile Framework for enterprise
- **LeSS**: Large-Scale Scrum

## Team Organization

### Conway's Law
- **Statement**: "Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure"
- **Implication**: Team structure affects software architecture
- **Application**: Design teams around desired system architecture

### Team Topologies
1. **Stream-Aligned Teams**: Focus on single valuable stream of work
2. **Enabling Teams**: Help stream-aligned teams overcome obstacles
3. **Complicated Subsystem Teams**: Build and maintain complex subsystems
4. **Platform Teams**: Provide internal services to reduce cognitive load

### Cross-Functional Teams
- **Composition**: All skills needed to deliver value
- **Benefits**: Reduced dependencies, faster delivery, shared ownership
- **Challenges**: Skill gaps, coordination overhead
- **Success Factors**: Clear goals, autonomy, support

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
- **System Testing**: Test complete integrated system
- **Acceptance Testing**: Validate business requirements
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing
- **Benefits**: Better design, comprehensive test coverage, confidence in changes

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
