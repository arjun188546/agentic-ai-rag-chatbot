# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, from simple rule-based systems to complex neural networks.

## Types of AI

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Examples: Siri, Alexa, recommendation systems
- Current state of most AI applications

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
- Human-level intelligence across all domains
- Theoretical concept, not yet achieved
- Goal of long-term AI research

### 3. Superintelligent AI
- Surpasses human intelligence
- Speculative future possibility
- Subject of ongoing ethical debates

## Key AI Technologies

### Machine Learning
- Subset of AI that learns from data
- Types: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning
- Applications: Image recognition, natural language processing

### Deep Learning
- Subset of machine learning using neural networks
- Inspired by brain structure
- Breakthrough technology for many AI applications

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- AI's ability to understand and generate human language
- Applications: Chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis
